  <h1>Building the logic</h1>
  <br>
<p>What we know from the given data is, <br>
  1. The client has collected data from 4 of its factories.<br>
  2. Each location has 9 types of machines;<br>
     A message is sent every 10min- i.e., the time interval for a data read <br>
  3. This process has been for a month.<br>
  4. The client wants to know, mainly where their machines are breaking down; and in which location the machine broke down the most. <br>
<br>
<br>
Looking at this data at face value, there a geographical factor involved. <br>
If using basic intuition; we could say that the most distant factory from home might be the faulty/breaking down the most.<br>
<br>
But intuition alone is not enough hence we will analysis data, represent it and answer the client's questions using Tableau.
