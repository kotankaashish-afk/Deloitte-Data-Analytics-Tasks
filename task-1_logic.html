<h1>Building the logic</h1>
<p>What we know from the given data is, 
  1. The client has collected data from 4 of its factories.
  2. Each location has 9 types of machines;
     A message is sent every 10min- i.e., the time interval for a data read 
  3. This process has been for a month.
  4. The client wants to know, mainly where their machines are breaking down; and in which location the machine broke down the most. 

Looking at this data at face value, there a geographical factor involved. 
If using basic intuition; we could say that the most distant factory from home might be the faulty/breaking down the most.

But intuition alone is not enough hence we will analysis data, represent it and answer the client's questions using Tableau.
